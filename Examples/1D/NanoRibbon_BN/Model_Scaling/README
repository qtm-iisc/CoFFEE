This folder computes E^{lat} for a B vacancy in 
a BN nanoribbon in the -1 charge state.

The lattice correction term, E^{lat}, is given by 
(Eqn. 4 in the CoFFEE paper):
E^{lat} = E^{iso,m}- E^{per,m}

To obtain the isolated model energy for this system, 
the model periodic energy is computed for several supercell sizes.
These values are then fit with a third order polynomial as 
shown in Fig. 8 (e) in the CoFFEE paper. This polynomial 
has the form:
p(\alpha) = f_0 + f_1/\alpha + f_2/\alpha^2 + f_3/\alpha^3
 
where \alpha denotes the supercell dimension: 
\alpha x 2.31\alpha x \alpha.
The polynomial extrapolation, 1/\alpha -> 0, gives 
the E^{iso,m}.
The lattice parameter is 4.74 bohr. The cell 
dimensions for \alpha = 6 are:
28.44, 65.6964 and 28.44 along x, y and z 
directions respectively.

Note that computing this term for large supercell sizes 
can be time consuming. The users can make use of the 
MPI parallelization of this code.

We provide the sample input files for the 
various supercell sizes in folders alpha.*. 
To understand how this example works, the model 
energy can be computed for a few small supercell sizes. 
We provide the results for the larger supercell sizes and 
a script to plot the polynomial.

To run this example, perform the following steps:
1. Go to the folders alpha.6 and run the following command:
python3 path_to_coffee_folder/coffee.py in > out
2. Go to the folders alpha.8 and run the following command:
python3 path_to_coffee_folder/coffee.py in > out
3. Go to the folders alpha.10 and run the following command:
python3 path_to_coffee_folder/coffee.py in > out

(Feel free to run the other supercell sizes as well)
To run the code in parallel:
mpirun -np 12 python3 your_path_to_CoFFEE/coffee.py in > out

The model total energy is printed in the out files.
The following command will show this energy:
grep ! out
The dielectric profile, model potential and 
model charge density are written out in numpy 
save files. Instruction on how to plot these is provided 
in the Plot folder within the alpha.* folders

For this example, the model energies should be:
6x14x6: 1.4569 eV
8x18.66x8: 1.5899 eV
10x23.33x10: 1.6507 eV

15x34.99x15: 0.529 eV
20x46.66x20: 0.588 eV
30x69.99x30: 0.618 eV

Use plot_fit.py to compute the fifth order polynomial fit 
and extrapolation to obtain E^{iso,m} for these values.
E^{iso,m} is computed to be 1.88 eV

The corrections, are then given by: 
(E^{iso,m}- E^{per,m}) 
6x14x6: 0.423 eV
8x18.66x8: 0.291 eV
10x23.33x10: 0.229 eV
